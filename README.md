# Usage 

## Demo User
There is a **Demo** login that allows access to the site. However, the Demo User Login does **NOT** use your geolocation, but instead uses a hard-coded latitude and longitude. If you would like to see routes in your local area, either manually navigate to your region or sign up for the site to get instant data on your area.
