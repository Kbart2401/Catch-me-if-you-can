## Summary
Catch Me If You Can is a fun, competitive app that lets you create and track routes that you've walked, biked or ran. Add friends ("rivals") and they can track their own times on your route. Each route has a leaderboard to see who has the fastest time!

## Features
### Interactive map using Â© MapBox api 
  - Create routes using markers for start and finish of a route
  - Search for beginning points of routes within a certain radius using the app's Find a Route feature

### Dashboard that tracks several key metrics
  - Most recent route's time to completion and distance
  - Total distance along routes
  - Total time on routes
  - Total calories burned
### Community page with the following features
  - Search for other users ("rivals") and add them to your community
  - See community members' profile and dashboard
### View all the personal routes you've added and view their leaderboards

# Usage 

## Demo User
There is a **Demo** login that allows access to the site. However, the Demo User Login does **NOT** use your geolocation, but instead uses a hard-coded latitude and longitude. If you would like to see routes in your local area, either manually navigate to your region or sign up for the site to get instant data on your area.
